# makeup-app

This is an app for organizing makeup.  

Makeup database app where you can track your usage
I want customizable NFC tags for the cosmetics & a stand alone art object that has a readout display NFC reader, I wanted it to play a sound but if it has network capabilities that has the potential to be turned into a mic and idk if I want that so maybe just lights? 
I want the display to show a fortune when you scan a product. 
the app tracks what you put on when so if you wanna see if that 18 hr lip lasts 18 hr or not. 
the app has like collections or orders of operations so like if you want to doa 42 setp sink care system you can like keep track of that. 
you can have like wish lists and like follow other peoples collections and like private or public collections you have to have an account to like see the content; 
would be a web app but accessable from a browser. 
kind of like pastel and black probably.
